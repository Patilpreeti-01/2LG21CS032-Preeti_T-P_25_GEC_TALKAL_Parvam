Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things. The word environment is used to talk about many things. For example, trees, rivers, and oceans are a part of the environment. People in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently. </p>
            
                <p style="letter-spacing: 5px;">Electromagnetic environment is radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields. The environment of a galaxy may mean the interstellar medium, or it may mean other nearby galaxies.</p>

               <p style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Environment includes the living and non-living things that an organism interacts with, or that have an effect on it. Living elements that an organism interacts with are known as biotic elements: animals, plants, etc. Abiotic elements are non-living things which include air, water, sunlight etc. Studying the environment means studying the relationships among these various things. An example of interactions between non-living and living things is plants getting their minerals from the soil and making food using sunlight. Predation, an organism eating another, is an example of interaction between living things. </p> 
                <p style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><del>Environmentalists think we should protect the natural environment, to keep it safe. Things in the natural environment that we value are called natural resources. For example, fish, insects, and forests. These are renewable resources because they come back naturally when we use them. Non-renewable resources are important things in the environment that are limited for example, ores and fossil fuels after a few thousand years. Some things in the natural environment can kill people, such as lightning.</del></p>

                <p style="padding:0 350px; font-size:22px;line-height: 2;"> The environment word is derived from the French term “environ” which means surroundings.

                    Thus, our surroundings refer to our environment, which constitutes the organism, materials, and energies. The environment provides the favorable conditions for living organisms to live and grow. The entire organism wants to survive with a consistent supply of resources and the elimination of waste.
                    
                    The biotic (living organism) and abiotic (non-living organism) are included in the environment. The climate, the weather, and the natural resources have a direct impact on human existence, and economic activities are included in this environment.</p>
