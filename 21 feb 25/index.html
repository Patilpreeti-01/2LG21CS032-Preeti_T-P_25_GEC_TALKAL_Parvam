<h2 style="color:green;">Origin and founding</h2>
<p><b>The International Sanitary Conferences (ISC),</b><i> the first of which was held on 23 June 1851</i>, were a series of conferences that took place until 1938, about 87 years.The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with cholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most of the 19th century. With the cause, origin, and communicability of many epidemic diseases still uncertain and a matter of scientific argument, international agreement on appropriate measures was difficult to reach.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:40px;">EXPRESSION</h1>
<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 0, 60);">Algebraic expression</h2>
<p>a<sup>2</sup> – b<sup>2</sup> = (a – b)(a + b)</p>
    <p>(a + b)<sup>2</sup>= a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>
    a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)<sup>2</sup> – 2ab.</p>
    <p>(a – b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> – 2ab + b<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>(a + b + c)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca.</p>
    <p>(a – b – c)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>+ c<sup>2</sup> – 2ab + 2bc – 2ca.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Chemical expression</h2>
<p> 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p> Zn + CuSO<sub>4</sub> → ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + Cu</p>
<p>2Na + Cl<sub>2</sub> → 2NaCl</p>
<p>CaCO<sub>3</sub> → CaO + CO<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Zn + CuSO<sub>4</sub> → ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + Cu  </p>
